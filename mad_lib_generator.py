'''One very nice morning near the end of summer,
my mother woke me up at 4:00 A.M. and said, "Wake
up and smell the grass, sleepy head! Today is your
first day of school and you can't be late." I groaned in
my bed for twenty seconds, but eventually I got
dressed. I wore a blue and white striped, long sleeve
_______________(noun) with a collar on it, a red tie,
dark gray pants, white socks, black shoes, and a(n)
_______________(adjective) hat. In ten minutes I made
lunch and ate my breakfast. _______________(number)
minutes later, the bus came. A few minutes later, I
was at school.
In school, I met two really
_______________(adjective) kids. All of us became
friends very fast. That day we had Science, and
luckily my friends and I were at the same
_______________(noun) .My friends' names are
_______________(proper noun) and
_______________(proper noun). In Math we weren't
together, and that really bugged me. We learned what
_______________(plural noun) were, and when to use
them. At snack and recess, we played a game
together. It was extremely fun. At P. E., we were
____________(-ing verb) off of the ropes onto
_______________(plural noun). I thought it was a very
_______________(adjective) idea. In swimming class,
we needed to swim extremely
_______________(adverb), or else we would have to
swim longer.
Before I knew it, school was over. I grabbed all
my belongings and put them into my backpack. In two
minutes, the bus came. As I stepped into the bus I
shouted, "Goodbye, adios amigos, and shalom," to
my friends. Then I went into the bus. In a flash, I was
back home. This day was an extremely exciting day!'''
